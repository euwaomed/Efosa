                // 1) Make script readable
                // 2)Increments the counter automatically

           //Counter=0 is the initialization expression for the loop.
           //Counter<count is the termination expression for the loop. Once it is false, the loop ends.
           //counter++ is the increment expression that invoked after each iteration through the loop
                //I chose an increment of +1
